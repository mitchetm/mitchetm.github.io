                    <div>
                        <p>My name is Tyree Mitchell, I am currently a rising Senior Computer Science student studying at James Madison University. I am currently set to graduate in May 2020. I have a great interest in toying with game mechanics, embedded electronics, and applications that help solve various problems.</p>

                                    <p>First foray into C++ programming in a large project. Was an Open Source project in which I took up a more assistive role as a more experienced developer wrote much of the more complex systems such as networking. The project helped reinforce the concept of Entity-Component systems and their usefulness in more complex projects that require many objects.</p>

At the end of the semester we were given just a few weeks to implement a front-end application to the database. Developed in Java Swing and JDBC it represents what we've learned about databases from normalization to integration.</p>

We implemented AR signs to show how a simple infractructure change could help autonomous vehicles. Stickers would be placed on existing signs for vehicles to interpret. We won 2<sup>nd</sup> place.
