                        <p>My name is Tyree Mitchell, I have a great interest in working with low level systems programming, robotics, game development, machine learning, and currently learning reverse engineering. I graduated from James Madison University with a B.S. in Computer Science, with sights set on a Masters in Computer Science or Computer Engineering.<a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MdZa_nUWvYW2tdJRHkumyhiiV5vW7s-f/view?usp=sharing" > My Resume/Contact Info</a></p>

                                    <p>The focus of the research is HCI (Human Computer Interaction) between an autonomous vehicle and the elderly. I am currently the Robotics lead on the project. I am working to provide a stable robotics platform for the primary research of Human Computer Interaction. My responsibilities include creating solutions for commong robotics problems like planning, obstacle avoidance, and localization.</p>

                                    <p>First foray into C++ programming in a large project. Was an Open Source project in which I took up a more assistive role as a more experienced developer wrote much of the more complex systems such as networking. The project helped reinforce the concept of Entity-Component systems and their usefulness in more complex projects that require many objects.</p>

At the end of the semester we were given just a few weeks to implement a front-end application to the database. Developed in Java Swing and JDBC it represents what we've learned about databases from normalization to integration.</p>

We implemented AR signs to show how a simple infractructure change could help autonomous vehicles. Stickers would be placed on existing signs for vehicles to interpret. We won 2<sup>nd</sup> place.
